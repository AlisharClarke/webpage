		<h3>Benny Bio</h3>
    <p id="intro">
    	This is a webpage for my dog <strong>Benny.</strong> He is a 6 year old black labrador mix. He is <em>crazy</em> but always seems to be happy go lucky. He used to have curls but after years of combing it it has become more wavy.
    <p>
    <p id="likes">
      Benny likes: Pretzels, surfing, going outside, eating pillbugs (aka rollie pollies), chasing lizards and squirrels, eating his toes and sleeping.
    <p>
    <p id="dislikes">
      Benny dislikes: Getting his ears cleaned (he is prone to ear infections), being in small spaces, and cages (sorry benny)
